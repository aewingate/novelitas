## Characteristics of the Series
_La Novela Cómica_ is the shortest running series included in this digital library. While it did begin before _La Novela Teatral_, unlike _La Novela Corta_ and _La Novela Teatral_ which both reached 400+ issues, _La Novela Cómica_ only had a series run of 183 issues. Like _La Novela Teatral_, these issues were published weekly on Sundays [^1]. Also like _La Novela Teatral_, _La Novela Cómica_ mostly consisted of theatrical works not prose, so its issues are typographically structured like scripts. However, the issues are restricted to the comedic sub-genres of theater: sainetes (farces), juguetes cómicos (comedic sketches), operettas, revistas (revue/variety show), vaudeville, apropósitos (sketches), and many others. Works with music were very common [^2].

_La Novela Cómica_ did not have a consistent cover art scheme in the same way as _La Novela Corta_ and _La Novela Teatral_. Sometimes they just had photos of individuals associated with theater, such as in _Corazonadas_ above, but they also reproduced the winners of the poster contest they held for their covers [^3].

While the poster contest (Concurso de Carteles) was the most important contest put on by _La Novela Cómica_ (first prize 1,000 pesetas) it wasn't the only contest. They had another contest for a comedic play and for a comedic lyrical farce to be premiered at the Teatro Infanta Isabel and the Teatro Cómico. There was also a novel contest. García-Abad García describes these contests as a strategy for attracting new readers [^4].
