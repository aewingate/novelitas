## Characteristics of the series
_La Novela Corta_ was a series for literary works excluding drama because of the existence of _La Novela Teatral_. It was the first and longest running series among those published by Prensa Popular.  

It's goal was to present literature by well-known authors such as Benito Pérez de Galdos, Carmen de Burgos, and Ramón del Valle-Inclán and by acclaimed recent authors to a public that couldn't afford full size books. Most of the texts published in these pamphlet novels were deemed "inéditas," meaning "unpublished," so despite the cheapness of the format, readers were often getting new material. Interestingly, the series claimed that if any material called unpublished in the series had actually been published previously, it was not their fault, but instead the fault of the author who had misled them [^1]. Over the course of the series, 70 authors wrote 418 of these unpublished novels giving an average of 6 novels per author. 11 of the authors only wrote 1 novel for the series, but other authors like Carmen de Burgos and Diego San José wrote significantly more than the average, with 25 and 26 novels, respectively [^2].  

In addition to these (generally) previously unpublished novels, _La Novela Corta_ published issues containing classics, adaptations of works, and literary criticism. For example, no. 210 of La Novela Corta is titled _Estudio crítico de Galdós_.
