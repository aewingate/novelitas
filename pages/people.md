Alex Wingate is a PhD student at Indiana University Bloomington. She created this site as part of her MLS at Indiana University where she concentrated her studies around rare books librarianship and the digital humanities. In her research she is interested in the intersection between rare books, book history, and digital humanities, looking particularly at the early modern Hispanic World, but also occasionally at 20th-century Spain. She also has an MA in the History of the Book from the University of London and a BA in Hispanic Studies and Linguistics from the College of William and Mary.
