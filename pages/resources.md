## Other issues of La Novela Corta, La Novela Cómica, and La Novela Teatral

Because most of the issues of these pamphlet novels are in the public domain, there are many digitized facsimiles of the novels. I have done my best to scour large Spanish digital libraries like the Biblioteca Virtual de Andalucía and the Biblioteca Digital Hispánica from the Biblioteca Nacional de España as well as projects like HathiTrust and Internet Archive. I've arranged them chronologically within their series.
