## Characteristics of the Series
_La Novela Teatral_ defined itself against _La Novela Corta_ and _La Novela Cómica_ through its publication of dramatic texts. The texts inside these issues instead of being formatted like prose follow the conventions of scripts. As opposed to the texts of _La Novela Corta_ which were specifically advertised as being unpublished, the scripts published in _La Novela Teatral_ are advertised as being performed. José Antonio Pérez Bowie writes that the intended audience of _La Novela Teatral_ was clearly people who had gone to the theater to see the show and then wanted to be able to re-experience it by reading the script [^1].

A notable visual characteristic of _La Novela Teatral_ are its covers. As opposed to _La Novela Corta_ and _La Novela Cómica_ which often used author photographs as their cover art, almost all of the cover illustrations for _La Novela Teatral_ are caricatures drawn by Manuel Tovar from Granada, who was one of the most famous caricature artists of his time. These four-color illustrations are of some person well-known in the world of theater, but not necessarily related to that particular issue [^2]. For example, in _Las superhembras_ at left, the caricature is of Sofia Casanova, the author of another item in this digital library _Triunfo de Amor_. 

The authors featured in _La Novela Teatral_ are mostly Spanish from either the 19th or 20th century. There are less contemporary foreign plays such as La Giaconda by Gabriele D'Annuzio and a few classic pieces of foreign drama like Shakespeare's Hamlet. Overall, only 70 titles by foreign authors (mostly French) were published, which makes up just 15% of the total series run. Surprisingly, there are only eleven Golden Age works of drama: three by Lope de Vega, two by Calderón, and one each by Tirso de Molina, Agustín Moreto, Vélez de Guevara, Guillén de Castro, Rojas Zorilla, and Ruiz de Alarcón. This makes sense given that the issues are trying to reflect the plays that were currently playing to be sold to the public that just saw them [^3]. The author with the most works published in _La Novela Teatral_ is Enrique García Álvarez with 33 issues, though the majority are colaborations with other authors. Carlos Arniches and Pedro Muñoz Seca each had 26 works (single and multi-author), while Vital Aza is in third place for the greatest number of works with 22. One of his most interesting works is _Francfort: juguete cómico tetralingue_ (no. 32, 1917) which has dialogue in German, French, Spanish, and Catalan.

The range of theatrical genres represented in the series is varied: comedies, dramas, tragedies, melodramas, and even musical works like zarzuelas [^4]. Las superhembras is described as a comedy.
